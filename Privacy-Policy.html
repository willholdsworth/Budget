        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Budget Base, the minimalist budgeting application developed by Will Holdsworth ("we," "our," or "us"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you use our mobile application ("Budget Base" or the "App"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information.</p>

        <h2>Summary of Key Points</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The App stores all data locally on your device.</li>
            <li>We do not collect, transmit, or store your financial data on any external servers.</li>
            <li>No account creation or login is required to use the App.</li>
            <li>You can export your budget data as an encoded text file for backup purposes.</li>
            <li>If you delete or uninstall the App, your data cannot be recovered.</li>
            <li>The App operates entirely offline with no internet connectivity requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>App Functionality and Data Handling</h2>
        <p>Budget Base is designed with simplicity and privacy in mind. The App provides the following features, all of which operate locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creation and management of weekly and monthly budgets</li>
            <li>Income and expense tracking</li>
            <li>Savings goals monitoring</li>
            <li>Multiple budget views and reporting</li>
            <li>Data export functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Local Storage of Information</h2>
        <p>All data you input into the App, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Budget categories</li>
            <li>Income entries</li>
            <li>Expense records</li>
            <li>Savings goals</li>
            <li>Budget settings and preferences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>is stored exclusively on your device's local storage using secure, native data storage methods. We do not transmit any of this information to our servers or any third-party servers.</p>

        <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We do not collect, use, or share any personal information about you, your finances, or your device. The App functions entirely offline and does not connect to the internet to send or receive any of your data. There are no analytics, tracking, or monitoring systems in place.</p>

        <h2>Export Feature</h2>
        <p>The App provides a feature that allows you to export your budget data as an encoded .txt file. This exported file remains under your control, and you decide if and with whom to share it. We do not have access to these exported files. This feature exists solely to provide you with backup capabilities and the ability to transfer your data between devices if desired.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since all data remains on your device, the security of your information depends on the security measures you have implemented on your device. We recommend using standard security practices such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Setting a strong device passcode</li>
            <li>Enabling biometric authentication if available</li>
            <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
            <li>Not sharing your device with others who shouldn't have access to your financial information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>Your data remains stored on your device until you choose to delete it through the App or uninstall the App entirely. Once the App is uninstalled, all associated data is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered. We do not maintain any backups of your data on our servers, as we never receive or store your data in the first place.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Budget Base is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy at https://www.willholdsworth.com/Budget/Privacy-Policy and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>

        <h2>Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
        <p>will.holdsworth.design@gmail.com</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. However, since we do not collect any of your personal information, these rights generally do not apply to our App. As all your data remains solely on your device under your control, you maintain full rights over that data at all times.</p>

        <h2>App Store Information</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is provided to comply with the requirements of various app distribution platforms. Budget Base is available on the App Store and potentially other platforms in the future.</p>

        <h2>Consent</h2>
